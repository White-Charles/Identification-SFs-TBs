# Identification-SFs-TBs
[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

This program is an algorithm to identify SFs and TBs in FCC crystal in molecular dynamics. It can cooperate with `Ovito` to realize post-processing.

## Install
1. Download source code. 
2. Installed `Matlab`.
This program is written in the environment of MATLAB 2017, which does not mean that this version or higher must be used to run this program. Earlier versions are still compatible.
3. Installed `Ovito`.
This program realizes the interaction with ovito through `data` files, so `Ovito` needs to be installed.
  
## Quick Start:
If you downloaded the source code，open a terminal in current directory and run: "main.m". There is already an example `test.data` to test the program. The program will output a `copy_test.data` to overwrite the `copy_test.data` in the current directory.
